        "Options": "A. The resulting increase in autocorrelation of the chain partially offsets the benefits of higher acceptance rates.\nB. Decreasing the proposal variance leads to smaller step sizes and a slower exploration of the parameter space.\nC. Both A and B are correct.\nD.

        "Options": "A. Alpha (\u03b1) should be set to its highest possible value to expand the axial points farthest from the design center and explore the maximum area of the response surface.\nB. Alpha (\u03b1) can be obtained from any random number, as its magnitude doesn't significantly affect the CCD design.\nC. Alpha (\u03b1) can be calculated as the fourth root of the number of design points in the factorial portion of the CCD to maintain rotatability.\nD.
